# last.fm to spotify playlist

A simple single-page app to create a spotify playlist from your top last.fm songs. 
Built using Svelte and without a backend or database.

The service is currently hosted using github pages, which is really convenient but also comes with a few issues.

## Apple Music Integration 

Adding Apple Music functionality would be cool, but in order to use their API need an account enrolled in Apples developer program is required, which is 100â‚¬/year. ðŸ¤¡
